## Project Overview

This repository contains two educational projects for building a modern, responsive image swiper slider inspired by Shopify:

- **image-swiper-jquery**: A static, jQuery + SwiperJS implementation
- **image-swiper-reactjs**: A modular, React + SwiperJS implementation with Vite

Both projects demonstrate how to create a sleek, interactive product gallery with smooth navigation, pagination, and custom styling. Perfect for e-commerce, portfolios, or any site needing a beautiful image slider.

## Features

- Responsive, mobile-friendly design
- SwiperJS-powered slider with navigation and pagination
- Clickable product slides with redirect functionality
- Customizable styles and easy-to-edit structure
- SEO-optimized HTML with rich metadata
- Educational code and documentation for learning and reuse

## How Each Project Works

### image-swiper-jquery (Static)

- Uses static HTML, CSS, jQuery, and SwiperJS.
- All logic is in `script.js` and all styles in `styles.css`.
- Product images are in the `images/` folder.
- Clicking a slide redirects to `/product/{productId}` (customize as needed).
- No build step or backend requiredâ€”just open `index.html` in your browser.

### image-swiper-reactjs (React Project)

- Built with React, SwiperJS, and Vite for a modern, component-based approach.
- Routing handled by React Router (`/` for slider, `/product/:id` for product page).
- All logic and styles are modularized in the `src/` folder.
- Product images are in the `public/` folder.
- Run locally with `npm install` and `npm run dev`.

---

## Quick Start

### image-swiper-jquery

1. Go to the `image-swiper-jquery` folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

### image-swiper-reactjs

1. Go to the `image-swiper-reactjs` folder.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the app in your browser at the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

---

## Usage & Integration

- Both projects are designed for easy reuse and extension.
- Copy the relevant files or components into your own project.
- Update image paths, product details, and styles as needed.
- For React, you can import and reuse the `ImageSlider` and `ProductPage` components in any React app.

---

## .env File & Environment Variables

Both projects are fully static and do **not** require a `.env` file or any environment variables for basic usage. If you wish to extend the React project with API endpoints or dynamic data, you can add your own `.env` file and reference variables in your scripts as needed (see [Vite environment variables](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html)).

---

## API Endpoints & Routes

- **image-swiper-jquery**: Clicking a slide triggers a redirect to `/product/{productId}`. You can implement these routes in your backend or static site as needed.
- **image-swiper-reactjs**: Uses React Router for `/` (slider) and `/product/:id` (product page). No external API calls are made by default.

## Example Code Snippet: Swiper Initialization (jQuery)

```js
$(document).ready(function () {
  var swiper = new swiper(".swiper", {
    pagination: {
      clickable: false,
      el: ".swiper-pagination",
    },
    navigation: {
      nextEl: ".swiper-button-next",
      prevEl: ".swiper-button-prev",
    },
    on: {
      init: function () {
        var $pagination = $(this.el).find(".swiper-pagination");
        var $nextButton = $(this.el).find(".swiper-button-next");
        var $prevButton = $(this.el).find(".swiper-button-prev");
        $pagination.prepend($prevButton);
        $pagination.append($nextButton);
      },
    },
  });
});
```

## Example Code Snippet: Swiper Initialization (React)

```jsx
<Swiper
  modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Scrollbar, A11y]}
  navigation={{ clickable: true, el: ".swiper-navigation" }}
  pagination={{ clickable: true, el: ".swiper-pagination" }}
  spaceBetween={spaceBetween}
  slidesPerView={slidesPerView}
  loop={true}
>
  {mockImages.map((image) => (
    <SwiperSlide
      key={image.id}
      onClick={() => handleImageClick(image.productId)}
    >
      {/* ...slide content... */}
    </SwiperSlide>
  ))}
</Swiper>
```
