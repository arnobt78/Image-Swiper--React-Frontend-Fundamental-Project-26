# Shopify Style Image Swiper Slider - jQuery, React, SwiperJS Project Tutorial

---

## Project Overview

This repository contains two educational projects that demonstrate how to build a modern, responsive image swiper slider inspired by Shopify:

- **image-swiper-jquery**: A static HTML/CSS/JS project using jQuery and SwiperJS.
- **image-swiper-reactjs**: A modern React app using SwiperJS, React Router, and Vite.

Both projects are designed for learning, teaching, and easy integration into your own web projects.

---

## Features

- Responsive, mobile-friendly design
- SwiperJS-powered slider with navigation and pagination
- Clickable product slides with redirect functionality
- Customizable styles and easy-to-edit structure
- SEO-optimized HTML with rich metadata
- Modular, reusable components (React version)
- No backend requiredâ€”fully client-side

## How Each Project Works

### image-swiper-jquery (How It Works)

- Uses static HTML, CSS, and JS (jQuery + SwiperJS)
- All logic is in `script.js` and all styles in `styles.css`
- Product images are in the `images/` folder
- Clicking a slide redirects to `/product/{productId}` (customize as needed)
- No build stepâ€”just open `index.html` in your browser

### image-swiper-reactjs (How It Works)

- Built with React, SwiperJS, React Router, and Vite
- `src/components/ImageSlider.jsx` displays the Swiper slider
- `src/components/ProductPage.jsx` displays product details based on the URL
- `src/shopifySchema.js` provides slider configuration
- Product images are in the `public/` folder
- Run locally with `npm install` and `npm run dev`

---

## Quick Start

### image-swiper-jquery

1. Open `image-swiper-jquery/index.html` in your browser.
2. No build or install step required.

### image-swiper-reactjs

1. Navigate to `image-swiper-reactjs/` in your terminal.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the app in your browser at the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

---

## Usage & Integration

- Both projects are designed to be easily copied and integrated into your own sites.
- Update image paths and product details as needed.
- Customize styles to match your branding.
- The React version's components are modular and reusable in any React project.

---

## Example: Adding a New Slide (jQuery Version)

```html
<div
  class="swiper-slide image-container"
  data-product-id="product6"
  onclick="redirectToProduct(this)"
>
  <img src="images/image6.png" alt="" />
  <div class="text-overlay">
    <p class="subtitle">New Product Title</p>
    <p class="subsubtitle">Product Subtitle</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

---

## Example: Adding a New Slide (React Version)

```jsx
// In src/components/ImageSlider.jsx
const mockImages = [
  // ...existing images
  { id: 6, src: "/image6.png", productId: "product6" },
];
```

---

## .env File & Environment Variables

Both projects are fully static and do **not** require a `.env` file or any environment variables for basic usage. If you wish to extend the React project with API endpoints or dynamic data, you can add your own `.env` file and reference variables in your scripts as needed (see [Vite environment variables](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html)).

---

## API Endpoints & Routes

- **jQuery Version**: Clicking a slide triggers a redirect to `/product/{productId}`. You can implement these routes in your backend or static site as needed.
- **React Version**: Uses React Router for `/` (slider) and `/product/:id` (product details). No external API calls are made by default.

---

## Reusing Components

- The Swiper slider structure and logic can be copied into any HTML or React project.
- Update the configuration and image data to fit your needs.
- The CSS is modular and can be imported into other projects.

## Example Code Snippet: Swiper Initialization (jQuery)

```js
$(document).ready(function () {
  var swiper = new swiper(".swiper", {
    pagination: {
      clickable: false,
      el: ".swiper-pagination",
    },
    navigation: {
      nextEl: ".swiper-button-next",
      prevEl: ".swiper-button-prev",
    },
    on: {
      init: function () {
        var $pagination = $(this.el).find(".swiper-pagination");
        var $nextButton = $(this.el).find(".swiper-button-next");
        var $prevButton = $(this.el).find(".swiper-button-prev");
        $pagination.prepend($prevButton);
        $pagination.append($nextButton);
      },
    },
  });
});
```

---

## Example Code Snippet: Swiper Initialization (React)

```jsx
<Swiper
  modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Scrollbar, A11y]}
  navigation={{ clickable: true, el: ".swiper-navigation" }}
  pagination={{ clickable: true, el: ".swiper-pagination" }}
  spaceBetween={spaceBetween}
  slidesPerView={slidesPerView}
  loop={true}
>
  {mockImages.map((image) => (
    <SwiperSlide
      key={image.id}
      onClick={() => handleImageClick(image.productId)}
    >
      {/* ...slide content... */}
    </SwiperSlide>
  ))}
</Swiper>
```
