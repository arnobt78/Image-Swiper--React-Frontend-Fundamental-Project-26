## Project Overview

I couldn't do it properly as the requirement was to use the SwiperJS library to display the navigation left and right arrow courser below the image and display the pagination dots placed in between the navigation arrows (like < . . . > )

I tried in many different ways and achieved the result in many ways, but unfortunately not exactly that < . . . > way!

I have used two different ways to achieve the goal; jQuery develops folder one, and folder two is produced by reactjs.

I have explained the project step by step and completed the documentation in the README.md file separately for two two-file projects. You can find the detailed overview inside each project's folder README.md file.
